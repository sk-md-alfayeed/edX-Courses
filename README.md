## Applied Deep Learning Capstone Project

In this capstone project, you'll use either Keras or PyTorch to develop, train, and test a Deep Learning model. Load and preprocess data for a real problem, build the model and then validate it.

Finally, you will present a project report to demonstrate the validity of your model and your proficiency in the field of deep learning.
